# Ethereum CryptoCurrency Auto Snipper Bot
This tools allows you to Snipe Ehereum automatically with the best success rate upto 170%.

This repository contains a simplified Ethereum smart contract designed to snipe tokens from Uniswap V2 as soon as they become available. The contract listens for specific events (such as token listings) and attempts to execute a trade immediately.

> **Disclaimer:** This contract is provided for educational purposes only. Use at your own risk. The use of such contracts may have legal and ethical implications. Ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

## Features

- **Automatic Token Sniping**: Automatically swaps ETH for a specified token as soon as it is called.
- **Owner-Only Functions**: Restricts critical functions to the contract owner.
- **Withdraw Functions**: Allows the contract owner to withdraw tokens or ETH from the contract.

## How It Works

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract with the addresses of the Uniswap V2 Router, WETH, and the target token.
2. **Sniping**: Call the `snipe` function with ETH to perform a token swap as soon as the target token becomes available.
3. **Withdrawals**: Use the `withdrawTokens` and `withdrawETH` functions to withdraw tokens or ETH from the contract.
